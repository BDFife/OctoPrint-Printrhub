# OctoPrint-Printrhub

This plugin is a work in progress. The goal is to skin OctoPrint via a plugin to make it look and behave more like Printrbot.cloud. 

## Setup

Currently, this plugin is not published via the plugin manager or available as a .zip package. 

The plugin requires https://github.com/fogleman/fauxgl to be installed on the system. More details will be provided as the project stabilizes. 

## Configuration

**TODO:** Describe your plugin's configuration options (if any).

## Info

If you'd like to get involved with this project, talk to Brian (@bdfife) or Brook (@printrbot).
